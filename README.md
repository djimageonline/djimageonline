< I am a huge Chicago Bulls fan, a long-time music enthusiast, a sucker for all Star Wars films, and in the process, I fell in love with the creativity coding allows me to have. I've dedicated the last couple of years to learning the fundamentals of software engineering through university education, a Full-Stack Web Development program called Global Tech, and a Coding Bootcamp at Actualize where I am now a Teaching Assistant supporting students with exercises and projects using Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, and other tech tools. Throughout my path, I've reinforced the material learned by creating and expanding on personal projects. Take a peak at my journey in my software engineering journal too. I write about my learnings, bugs and fixes, what I am working on and other interesting things I run into. I bring leadership, culture, innovation, and my passion for solving problems to make a difference in people’s lives. Especially through code. I’m committed to applying my skills and demonstrating my passion in development and engineering to ultimately provide a great user experience - of course while having fun doing it! >
